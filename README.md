# TodayFeed

### **What does TodayFeed do?**
TodayFeed is a web app that gathers the latest articles from three different news APIs and displays them as a newsfeed. 

Three APIs used:
- **1**:  **[News API](https://newsapi.org/)**
- **2**:  **[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)**
- **3**:  **[NY Times](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/top-stories-product/1/overview)**

***

### **What are some of TodayFeed's features?**

- Users may click on a dropdown placed on the navigation bar, where they may pick from one of three news sources.

- Each article features a photo, title, different metadata and a call to call to action to 'read more'.

- Users may click on an each individual article to get a preview inside a modal, where they may click to view the original article's source.

### **Unsolved Problems**
I included a the searchbar, but I was unable to add the "search" funtionality. I will try again in future iterations.
